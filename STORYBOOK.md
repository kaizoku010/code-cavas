# Storybook Integration for UI Component Generator

This document explains how to use the Storybook integration with the UI Component Generator.

## Overview

Storybook provides a dedicated environment for previewing UI components with proper framework support. This integration allows you to:

1. Generate UI components using the UI Component Generator
2. Create Storybook stories for these components
3. View and interact with the components in a proper framework environment
4. Export the components for use in your projects

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Storybook

To start the Storybook server:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will launch Storybook on port 6006. You can access it at http://localhost:6006

### Building Storybook

To build a static version of Storybook for deployment:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

This will create a `storybook-static` directory with the built Storybook.

## Using the Integration

1. **Generate a Component**: Use the UI Component Generator to create a component with your desired framework.

2. **Create a Story**: After generating a component, click the "Generate Storybook Story" button in the Preview section.

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Stories

You can customize the generated stories by editing the files in the `src/stories/generated` directory.

### Adding Controls

To add interactive controls to your stories, edit the story file and add an `argTypes` configuration:

```jsx
export default {
  title: 'Generated/shadcn/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
  argTypes: {
    variant: {
      control: { type: 'select', options: ['default', 'destructive', 'outline'] },
      defaultValue: 'default',
    },
    size: {
      control: { type: 'select', options: ['default', 'sm', 'lg'] },
      defaultValue: 'default',
    },
  },
};
```

### Adding Documentation

You can add documentation to your stories by using the `docs` parameter:

```jsx
export default {
  title: 'Generated/shadcn/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'This is a custom component generated by the UI Component Generator.',
      },
    },
  },
};
```
